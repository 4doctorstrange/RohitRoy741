<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an aspiring software developer currently pursuing my bachelors in CSE at Manipal University Jaipur.
  I like to learn new things and use them to solve daily life problems. Programming to me is an art which gives me power to create
  new things. Apart from coding I am a huge anime fan and nerdy book reader. When I am not coding, or watching anime, or reading something then either I am
  doing my laundry or sleeping. Or probably both :P.</p>
<h2>My Skills</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>C programming</h3>
    <p>I learned C programming during my first year at college. I like C for the flexibilty it provides in spite of its hard syntax. I hav a nice grip on topics like pointers,             array and structures, and up for a discussion about them any time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Java</h3>
    <p>I love Java for being a purely Object Oriented language. I have developed a command line shopping application in java and doing that made me realise hoe necessary OOP is for making complex and large projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Data Structures And Algorithms</h3>
    <p> That's like bread and butter of programming and honestly I love to learn and apply their concepts to real world problems.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>My Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Library Management Application</h3>
    <p>This is a Command Line Library Application that I developed in C programming language. I tried to take a minimalistic approach and used as few resources as possible. This application uses file handling to store data, however it provides all the basic CRUD functions. It provides separate interfaces for Admin and members.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Shooping App (MARK 3)</h3>
    <p>This is another CLI app I developed. This application uses various OOP's features of Java to provide various features of a shooping app. I am still developing it further and trying to add a RDBMS to store its data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Static Website (Fairy Tail)</h3>
    <p> This is one of my first projects and I used just HTML and CSS in it. Its a website just for fun and aesthetic purposes.</p>
