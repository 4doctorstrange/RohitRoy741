<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an aspiring software developer currently pursuing my bachelors in CSE at Manipal University Jaipur.
  I like to learn new things and use them to solve daily life problems. Programming to me is an art which gives me power to create
  new things. Apart from coding I am a huge anime fan and nerdy book reader. When I am not coding, or watching anime, or reading something, either I am
  doing my laundry or sleeping. Or probably both :P.</p>
<h2>My Skills</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>C programming</h3>
    <p>I learned C programming during my first year at college. I like C for the flexibilty it provides in spite of its hard syntax. I hav a nice grip on topics like pointers,             array and structures, and up for a discussion about them any time.</p>
    <h3>Java</h3>
    <p>I love Java for being a purely Object Oriented language. I have developed a command line shopping application in java and doing that made me realise hoe necessary OOP is for making complex and large projects.
    <h3>Data Structures And Algorithms</h3>
    <p> That's like bread and butter of programming and honestly I love to learn and apply their concepts to real world problems.
